        <h2>Introduction :</h2>
                            <p>
                                A curriculum-integrated teaching strategy called Design-Based Learning (DBL). 
                                It evaluates and fosters students’ capacity for both creative and practical 
                                thought. This method fosters critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative 
                                abilities. Problem-solving exercises encourage children to think creatively and 
                                unconventionally. Let us explore Design-Based Learning (DBL) in depth. 
                            </p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Understanding Design-Based Learning in School Education</h1>
                    <div class="dimg">
                        <img src="user/images/dbl1.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The foundation of design-based learning is the straightforwardness of an idea 
                        applicable in the real world. With a focused design approach, the problem can be solved. 
                        It covers issue-solving, conducting in-depth research, creating unique solutions, 
                        prototyping, testing, and iterating. Students who receive a style of training gain a 
                        thorough understanding of the material and pick up practical life skills.
                    </p>
                
            <h2 style=" text-align: center;" >It’s Relevance in School Education</h2>
                    <div class="dimg2">
                        <img src="user/images/dbl2.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>
                        Children are not well-prepared for the challenges they face in the fast-changing real 
                        world. DBL raises the relevance and appeal of education by combining theoretical 
                        knowledge with practical application. By encouraging students’ creativity, 
                        adaptability, and problem-solving skills, teachers can better prepare their students 
                        for the challenges of the twenty-first century.

        <h1>History and Evolution</h1>
                    <p>
                        Design-Based Learning (DBL) was inspired by the progressive educational system of the 
                        early 20th century, which primarily emphasizes experimental learning. Prominent 
                        educators such as John Dewey promoted learning by doing. The current version of DBL has 
                        been greatly impacted by the development of technology and a deeper comprehension of 
                        cognitive science, which validates the efficacy of inquiry-based, hands-on learning.
                    </p>

        <h2>Benefits of Design-Based Learning </h2>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                    1.When students work on topics that they are truly interested in and that have practical 
                    significance, they are more likely to be inspired, engaged, motivated, and inclined towards
                    learning. <br>
                    <br>
                    2.Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving are two abilities that DBL aids students in acquiring that
                    are critical in today’s society. <br>
                    <br>
                    3. DBL gives students a forum to showcase their original ideas and unique creative solutions.
                </p>

        <h2>Methodologies</h2>
                    <p>There are several methodologies to implement DBL in schools:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        1.
                        Students do tasks as project-based learning that require them to use the knowledge and <br>
                        abilities they have gained in practical settings.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2.Students explore problems and develop theories through inquiry-based learning, conducting <br>
                        research and activities to find the answers.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <h3>Q: What does Design-Based Learning (DBL) mean?</h3>
                <p>
                    A: One kind of instructional strategy that incorporates the complete design process 
                    into basic learning activities is called Design-Based Learning (DBL).Students identify 
                    problems, generate ideas for fixes, construct prototypes, and test their theories in an 
                    iterative improvement cycle. Students get an appreciation for creativity, critical
                    thinking, and problem-solving skills through this type of hands-on, project-based learning.
                </p>

            <h3>Q: How does DBL differ from traditional learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    A: DBL does not focus on passive absorption of information, unlike other traditional
                    methods. It focuses on active learning through practical projects. Students participate
                    in critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving. This experiential 
                    learning method aids in comprehension of the material on a deep level and increases their 
                    retention of it.
