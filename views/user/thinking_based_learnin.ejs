        <h2>Introduction :</h2>
                            <p>
                                More than ever, our teaching tactics, methods, and approaches are essential in the quickly changing 
                                educational environment of today. Modern and innovative learning approaches that place a priority 
                                on active involvement and critical thinking are posing a growing threat to traditional learning 
                                methods, which are typically typified by rote memorization and passive information absorption. 
                                Thinking-based learning is a revolutionary approach that promotes enhanced comprehension and
                                long-term memory recall.
                            </p>
        
        <h2>What is Traditional vs. Thinking-Based Learning?</h2>                    
                            <p>
                                Conventional teaching methods are based on a teacher-centred approach, in which students attempt
                                to absorb and remember the knowledge being taught. This approach prevents students from posing 
                                questions, working independently, or applying what they have learned in a practical environment and
                                fosters critical thinking and creativity.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                For example, in traditional maths classrooms, students work hard to memorise formulae and solve
                                problems without understanding the underlying concepts. Conversely, thinking-based learning
                                places more of an emphasis on students’ curiosity, problem-solving skills, and level of involvement.
                                It pushes students to ask questions, consider the content critically, and apply what they have
                                learned. In addition, streamlining the educational process develops the critical thinking abilities
                                needed to succeed in the globalisation in society today.
                            </p>

        <h2>Types of Thinking-Based Learning :</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many educational strategies are used in thinking-based learning such as;
                    </p>

        <h3>1.Inquiry-Based Learning :</h3>  
                <p>
                    It is a method perfectly apt for students wanting to explore questions and problems rather than
                    simply receiving information. It encourages active participation and curiosity among them.
                <br>
                <br>
                    For example, in a science lesson, students are asked to create and carry out experiments to
                    comprehend the fundamentals of physics.
                </p>         

        <h3>2.Project-Based Learning (PBL) :</h3>
                <p>
                    Students work on projects that require their knowledge and skills. It helps them to solve real-world 
                    problems. It encourages them to enhance critical thinking and collaboration.
                <br>
                <br>
                    For example in a social study project, students can use research papers, and designs with presenting 
                    abilities to construct a community plan to solve local area challenges.
                </p>

        <h3>3. Collaborative Learning :</h3>        
                <p>
                    When students study in small groups and discuss, they solve problems themselves. It enhances their 
                    ability to think critically and work effectively with others. For example, during debates on historical 
                    events in the classroom, students work together for arguments.
                </p>

        <h3>4.Problem-Based Learning (PBL) :</h3> 
                <p>
                    This approach focuses on developing students’ critical thinking and problem-solving abilities while
                    preparing them to tackle challenging issues that they ought to be able to resolve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For example, students wanted to write a case study on solving a public health crisis. It requires them
                    to research, analyse data, and propose solutions.
                </p>       

        <h2>Benefits of Thinking-Based Learning Strategies :</h2>
                <p>Thinking-based learning techniques have many advantages regarding cognitive development, such 
                    as:
                </p>

        <h3>1.Enhances Critical Thinking</h3>        
                <p>
                    Students are encouraged to ask questions and seek solutions through thinking-based learning. It
                    helps them develop their critical thinking skills. For example, in a literature class, students 
                    might evaluate a novel’s themes by asking and responding to questions regarding the text.
                </p>

        <h3>2. Improves Active Learning:</h3>        
                <p>
                    When there are active participants in education, students are more likely to be inspired and 
                    interested. For instance, maths classes have real-life applications of budgeting for a
                    personal project.
                </p>

        <h3>3.Improves Memory Retention</h3>
                <p>Active learning techniques improve comprehension and memory retention while improving academic
                    achievement. According to a study, students who engage in active learning tasks had higher
                    memory recall and retention rates.
                </p>

        <h2>Implementation of Thinking-Based Learning at Home</h2>
                <p>Parents can play a crucial role in fostering thinking-based learning at home by:</p>

        <h3>1.Explore Books and Reading Habits</h3>        
                <p>
                    Introduce kids to the world of books, riddles, and games that encourage critical thinking. 
                    For example, games like chess and puzzles will improve problem-solving abilities.
                </p>
            
        <h3>2. Share Ideas and Tricks</h3>
                <p>
                    Allow your children to play with their interests. Assist them in projects. Provide resources as per 
                    requirement. For instance, parents share ideas and teach tricks by working with a child to construct
                    a model of the solar system.
                </p>

        <h2>Thinking-Based Curriculum</h2>
                <p>
                    Every facet of education is integrated with critical 
                    thinking through a thinking-based curriculum. It involves on:
                </p>

        <h3>1. Exclusive Learning:</h3>
                <p>
                    Students must actively interact with the provided resources to benefit from exclusive
                    learning. For example, in a history class, students can make a timeline of historical
                    events and discuss how they affect modern society.
                </p>

        <h3>2.Solving Real-Life Problems</h3>        
                <p>
                    It includes real learning experiences that connect real-world issues, situations, and 
                    problems. For example, students want to design a sustainable garden. They use their 
                    understanding of biology, environmental science, and design principles.
                </p>

        <h3>3.Collaborative Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    Studying in groups helps students become more adept at working together and coming up with 
                    solutions for problems as a team.For example, in a technology class, students can create 
                    apps in small groups that solve issues in the community and promote creativity and teamwork.
                </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking-based learning emphasises enquiry, problem-solving, and active participation. 
                    It is a respectable and trustworthy substitute for conventional teaching approaches. 
                    Students are better prepared to tackle obstacles in the real world when they are taught 
                    to think critically in the classroom. This approach can be implemented in classroom 
                    settings and at home to improve academic performance, increase student engagement, and 
                    support the growth of problem-solving abilities.
